            <h1>An investigative platform for advocacy</h1>


            <p>Transparent Oil Namibia enables you to map, find, browse, and search petroleum exploration licenses. You can find which companies hold licenses, who owns and manages these companies, where they’re registered, and how ownership has changed over time. You can also access licence and company information by clicking on the map.</p>

            <p>The information on this platform is publicly available, but it was previously hard to access and use for advocacy without exhausting resources. Tracking license history in Namibia has often required sorting through hundreds of hardcopy pages of text. With improved accessibility to this data, you can more easily combat industry corruption and advocate for policy changes in Namibia.</p>

            <blockquote>
                “Such negative outcomes of resource extraction, commonly known as the resource curse.. can be countered by strong and unambiguous policies, accompanied by effective institutional structures. “ <a href="http://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=139106&page=archive-read">- The Namibian</a>
            </blockquote>

            <p>To the expense of the Namibian economy and its people, the current licensing system can be exploited by companies with politically-connected owners who get concession rights and resell them at a higher price.</p>

            <p>IPPR developed this platform to identify licensing patterns, red-flag corruption, and advocate for policy reform.</p>
